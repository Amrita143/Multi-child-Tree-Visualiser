# Multi-child-Tree-Visualiser
It's a Multi-child-tree-visualizer using HTML,CSS and JavaScript  and having functionalities like add element (duplicate elements not allowed) and delete element but there is a issue in the delete  element that  when we delete a non-leaf element, the whole subtree rooted with that element is deleted.
