# Organisational-Tree-Visualiser
It's a Organisational-Tree using Multi-child-tree-visualizer and having functionalities like "Hire Owner","Hire Employee", "Fire Emplyee" but there is an issue in the "Fire Emplyee" that  when we delete a non-leaf element, the whole subtree rooted with that element is deleted.
